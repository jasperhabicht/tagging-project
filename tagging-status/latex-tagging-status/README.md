# LaTeX Tagging Status
## Generation date: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

The file latex-tagging-status.ltx provides data extracted from the YAML source
of
https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/tagging-status/full

The TeX commands and their arguments are internal to code in latex-lab
and are likely to change.

So it is not possible to use them directly.
Instead latex-lab will provide higher level interfaces to the data.
